Sleep brings ideas.

Story - Teleported *inside* an Asteroid with the drill - have to load up on rare materials etc.
  - Story justification - Environmental impact of mining lasers / Orbital cracking / Spacejunk + Microparticles everywhere :D

  Miners enter these roids through quantum wormholes that can be semi-randomly opened in O2 pockets (hence your "insertion")
  Mineral and miner exfiltration occurs through these portals.

MINIMAL TASKS

When in contact with a portal - 
  Health up
  Fuel/O2? up
  [X] Minerals transfer over to permanent bank
    - Cool animation
  Upgrades can be purchased from the void
    - No cash, just banked materials
    - Mouse handler
    - Presented with three choices, based on depth of portal
    - Left of screen, middle of screen, right of screen.


LOSE CONDITIONS
  Player Death
    - Fall/Impact damage,
    - Gas pockets?
    - Cave Ins?
    - All the usual motherloadey stuff
      - Make sure to credit Motherload, Minecraft in creds

UI
  Main menu
    New Game
    Load (see below)
    Help  - Just a static text kinda screen?
      - Set up the lore :)

PREFERRED_TASKS
* Server side save at portal
* Server side file deletion on Death (ROGUELITE WHATTUP!)
    * Expand on conceopt by making each portal have 3 different available upgrades

* PARTICLES? MORE LIKE FULLICLES MUAHAHAHAHA
  - Make up for no art talent with flying bits

Motherload springs to mind :)

Motherload mechanics honestly appeal to me,
but what could I do different?
 
WHAT ARE MINERALS USED FOR?
 * Upgrades obviously
 * Expand on this
 * NOT keen on the idea of "sell for cash"
