<h2> Welcome </h2>



<p>
  Welcome to <strong>Octoreso</strong>, your mission running companion. We collect mission data and display it here, allowing you to plan ahead and know exactly what you're getting into.
</p>

<p>
  We aim to augment and expand upon the official Ingress map, by having better support for mission banners/sequences, and easier mission discovery. It's early days, and we appreciate your feedback to help us make this even better!
