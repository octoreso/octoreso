    %p My name is Toby Pinder, Rails and PHP developer by trade. Think of this site as a vault for some of my experiments (or non-pretentious words to that effect). Particular passion projects of mine include Ludum Dare games, data driven and statistical analysis tools, and digital and virtual economies and currencies.

      %p Ludum Dare 29 is coming ever so soon and I'm going to be streaming the entire thing live!

      %p In the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo">lead up to LD29</a> I'm going to be whipping myself into shape, through modifying my LD27 game "Astronomical Odds". Current thinking is that this modification is going to convert the game to a multiplayer shooter of sorts, but time will tell!

      LD27: Astronomical Odds

      %p I made a game for the Ludum Dare 27 called "Astronomical Odds". Ludum Dare is a 48 hour game development competition. As you can imagine, those are strict time constraints! I entered both LD21 and LD26 with some half-baked, abstract ideas implemented on the server side for the most part, but I was happy with my JS focused result, which boasted a surprisingly polished combat system (even if the enemy AI is... janky),
