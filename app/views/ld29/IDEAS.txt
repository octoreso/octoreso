== NEW PERSPECTIVES == 

Sleep brings ideas.

Story - Teleported *inside* an Asteroid with the drill - have to load up on rare materials etc.
  - Story justification - Environmental impact of mining lasers / Orbital cracking / Spacejunk + Microparticles everywhere :D

  Miners enter these roids through quantum wormholes that can be semi-randomly opened in O2 pockets (hence your "insertion")
  Mineral and miner exfiltration occurs through these portals.

MINIMAL TASKS
Add "bedrock" type
3x2 "Portal" areas similar to the start. Spawn regularly.
  - embed the starting one in 4x3 of bedrock with one exit!
When in contact with a portal - 
  Health up
  Fuel/O2? up
  Minerals transfer over to permanent bank
    - Cool animation
  Upgrades can be purchased from the void
    - No cash, just banked materials
    - Mouse handler
    - Presented with three choices, based on depth of portal
    - Left of screen, middle of screen, right of screen.


LOSE CONDITIONS
  Player Death
    - Fall/Impact damage,
    - Gas pockets?
    - Cave Ins?
    - All the usual motherloadey stuff
      - Make sure to credit Motherload, Minecraft in creds

UI
  Main menu
    New Game
    Load (see below)
    Help  - Just a static text kinda screen?
      - Set up the lore :)

PREFERRED_TASKS
* Server side save at portal
* Server side file deletion on Death (ROGUELITE WHATTUP!)
    * Expand on conceopt by making each portal have 3 different available upgrades

* PARTICLES? MORE LIKE FULLICLES MUAHAHAHAHA
  - Make up for no art talent with flying bits











  Each time drill enters new cell - send JSON
    * Masks latency
  Get response with contents of cell and visible minerals around player
  Accumulate player wealth direct to bank - add inv later.

Under the surface: 
* Digging Mechanics?
* Fights for resources?
* Cavesssss
* Limited Civilisation?

Very minecraftey theme tbh

Game about trading resources between players to fight for survival?

Motherload springs to mind :)

Motherload mechanics honestly appeal to me,
but what could I do different?

 -- Want to use Rails - idea of adding server side/multiplayer?

 -- Fighting for the same resources!

 * Latency and such not an issue because display would be best effort
 * Resources are either there or depleted
 * Grace period of x seconds for lag where two people can mine same block?


 ** SERVER **
cell_mineral(x,y,)
mineral(name, type, etc)

WHAT ARE MINERALS USED FOR?
 * Upgrades obviously
 * Expand on this
 * NOT keen on the idea of "sell for cash"

BASE
 * Base used for storage of gains?
 * Some sort of asynchronous base attacking
  * Kings of Chaos/Mechg were cool before F2P nonsense ruined them and morphed the genre into Skinner Box Zynga cash farms :)


WHAT CAN BE UNIQUE HERE?
* Drill types 
  * Mining certain minerals only possible with specialized drills
  * Encourages player choice
  * Players can work together for optimal mining if friendly
* "In world" PvP via mining around each other
* "aSync" PvP through typical "send units to base" time mechanics
* Players trade off storage of minerals vs risks
  * Losing a fight loses a percentage and makes safe a la most games of genre.
